# Group-projects
## This is a collection of group project that me and my classmates have created during our education

[Waterworks](https://github.com/styrbjorn-n/Waterworks): This was a group project in javaScript where we had to work with Gothenburgs open API about the waterlevel through ou the city.

[Naturally](https://github.com/lovbackan/Naturally): This was our first project in collaboration with the digidal design class, and the computer graphics design class. This was our second project ever. We got a design from the designers that represented a made up company and its products. And we got the pictures and animations from the computer graphics class.
